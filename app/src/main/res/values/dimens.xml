    <!-- Per the design guidelines, navigation drawers should be between 240dp and 320dp:
         https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html -->
    <dimen name="toolbar_elevation">4dp</dimen>
    <dimen name="action_button_margin">8dp</dimen>

    <!--
    The width of the margin along the left side of the view that is used to intercept touch events
    that control the timer. When the timer is not running, this margin prevents the timer from
    starting due to an accidental touch that was intended to access the side drawer menu. When the
    timer is running, this margin is not applied, so touching anywhere on the screen will stop the
    timer. This margin is not set on the view as "android:layout-marginLeft"; instead, it is used
    in the code to pass through intercepted touches only when the timer is not running.

    <dimen name="timer_touch_proxy_margin">16dp</dimen>

    <!--
    The size of the text for the non-image quick action buttons shown below a result time. There
    are two sizes, depending on the user's preferred action button size. The text size is given in
    DIP, not SIP, units to ensure the button layout is predictable.

    <!--
    The "timer_widget_time_height" is the desired height (not text size) of the text that presents
    the time value. The "TimerWidget" will be higher than this, as it allows space for a "headline"
    above the time. However, the widget is "clever" enough to treat this as a maximum value and to
    reduce it if necessary to fit within its bounds. The "layout_height" should simply be set to
    "wrap_content".
